                <p class="strong">How much time do you spend working on a computer?<br/>
                    We are developers and we spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen. And that is why we really care about our software tools. We're quite picky and have strong opinions how tools should work.
                    Chances are you are similar to us.<br>Let's <a href="http://blog.binaryage.com">share ideas, code and better workflows</a>!</p>

            <h1 class="about-title">The story behind BinaryAge</h1>
            <div class="about-story">
                <p class="strong">Antonin, the founder of BinaryAge, is a former <a href="http://2kczech.com">game programmer</a> who morphed into a <a href="http://transpond.com">web developer</a>. You can imagine it's a pretty long way going from Windows, DirectX and proprietary C++ game engines to OSX, dynamic languages and open web technologies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-story">
                <p class="strong">Stephen, the creator of TotalSpaces, is a former radio engineer who got hooked on Ruby and Objective C. And if you ever want to talk about <a href="http://ioccc.org/">obfuscated coding</a>, you know where to come.</p>
            </div>
            <h1 class="about-title">Why open-source?</h1>
            <div class="about-contribute">
                <p class="strong">We made <a href="/">the tools</a> primarily for ourselves because we wanted to work more effectively. Releasing them open-source was just a logical step and an opportunity to contribute back to the community.</p>
