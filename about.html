    info: "I started to play with the web back in the times when Netscape ruled the world. 
           First I've created a serious javascript-heavy IE6 project way before before AJAX was discovered. 
           Today I'm trying to go cross-browser with jQuery and various quality javascript frameworks. 
           I'm a big believer in the future of the web and a Douglas Crockford's fanboy. 
           My dream is to build a <a href=\"http://hashpage.com\">browser-centric IDE</a> one day."

           That is why I'm so excited about MacRuby. These days I do also
           iPhone development where I prefer web based UI (PhoneGap) with
           underlying Objective-C services. I'm also very interested 
           in SIMBL hacking and low-level OSX internals. This is exactly the skill set 
           needed for improving system apps like Terminal or Finder."

           we develop web applications today. I spent some time developing Firefox addons by extending Firebug functionality.
           I'm on a personal mission of improving tools
           for developers. Programming XUL is quite a pain but not as big pain as programming 
           COM addons for IE. That is why I look forward to developing for Chrome, which looks like an engineering masterpiece so far.",

                    I'm a developer and I spend a lot of time in front of a computer screen. And that is why I really care about my software tools. I'm quite picky and I have strong opinions how my tools should work.

                <p class="strong">I'm a former <a href="http://2kczech.com">game programmer</a> who morphed into a web developer. You can imagine it means pretty long way going from Windows, DirectX and proprietary C++ game engines to OSX, dynamic languages and open web technologies.</p>

                <p class="strong">I've been using many free and open-source tools during my career. I want to thank those authors and even if I didn't always contribute directly by donating money to them I really appreciate their work. This is sort of my pay-back. Working on cool projects is also a great opportunity to meet smart people and learn something.</p>
